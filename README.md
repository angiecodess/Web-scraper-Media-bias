# Web-scraper-Media-bias
Where do news sources fall on the political bias spectrum? In this project, I scraped data on https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings, parsed out the interesting/useful data, and did some data analysis to see which ratings for news outlets does the community absolutely agree on, strongly agree on, and so on. I'd also analyzed how reflective AllSides is of the public's opinion by comparing ratios and generated some visualizations.
